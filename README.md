Market Engine Simulator

Home made forex broker, where you can attach your own strategy and historic trading pair data (GBP/USD, BTC/USD, etc.).
Trading results are stored in a .csv format and it can be used with DPP (Data Post Process repository on my github) where
nicely formated .xls file is created.
